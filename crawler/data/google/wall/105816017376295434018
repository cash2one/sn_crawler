Jul 10, 2014, 5:59:20 PM	Dear AnySoftKeyBoard Team!Thanks for the great work!! I was wondering if you can provide me with some documents on how to setup the project on Eclipse. I have some ideas to add to the app, and since I am most familiar with Eclipse IDE I was wondering if you could help me out? Thank
